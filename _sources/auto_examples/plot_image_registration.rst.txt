Often scientists find themselves wanting to compare data of various origins on the same sample that has a location of
interest where multiple experiments have been carried out. Often, these data sets may not have the same resolution, not
have been captured over the exact same region, be distorted in different ways due to drift, and even have different
dimensionality. In this example, we will make use of algorithms which attempt to find the best alignment transformation
between data sets.

Below, the Normalized Topo Image is a result of STM (scanning tunneling microscope) imaging captured prior to
collecting a lower spatial resolution, 3D scanning tunneling spectroscopic (STS) data set that experienced drift as
is evident shown in Z Channel Spectroscopy (where Z is height roughly corresponding to topography). We would like to
map the spectroscopic result onto exact locations in the 2D map (high resolution) to correlate topo features to the
electronic effects captured by STS. To do this, the image (and the associated full 3D data set) on the right needs to
be transformed to look like the image on the left.

Clearly, this data file has several datasets, many of them are supporting information for central or main datasets.

The data are formatting according to the Universal Spectroscopic and Imaing Data (USID) model and is stored in a
Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) file. To learn more about this standardized file format for imaging and spectroscopic
data, please visit `here <https://pycroscopy.github.io/USID/about.html>`_.
However, data formatting will not be the focus of this example.

Access and Visualize
--------------------
Let us look at one of these `USID` `Main` datasets - the Topography.
Our sister-package - pyUSID has a class called the ``USIDataset`` that makes it easy to operate on large,
multi-dimensional scientific datasets.
Just printing out the USIDataset shows rich scientific information embedded within this object.
We can also use USIDataset's ``visualize()`` method to quickly visualize the dataset

Interpolate image and the Z channel data
----------------------------------------
Since our goal is to maximize overlap between the two datasets, we should create some additional datasets with
matching sizes. The Topo image data is 1024 x 1024 pixels, whereas the STS data is 40 x 40 spatial pixels (plus a 3rd
dimension of 256 points)

Let’s create two additional images – an interpolated STS image that is now 1024 x 1024 and a reduced Topo image
that’s 40 x 40

First we create an interpolant model, and then evaluate it at an interval that would give us the desired image size

Preparing for image registration
----------------------------------------
We now have a choice to make – whether we want to register two 40 x 40 images: Reduced Topo and the original STS, or
register the two 1024 x 1024 images: Original Topo and the interpolated STS, or do both.

If you have the time and resources, doing both is a good idea to get a handle on the quality of the registration.
Let’s try mapping the larger images in this example

Before getting started, it’s a good idea to also think about what data you’d like to use a reference and which data
should get transformed. Data that is to remain invariant is referred to as the ‘fixed’ image and the data to get the
transformation is referred to as ‘moving.’ In our case we want to map the STS data onto the image data, so Topo is
‘fixed’ and STS is ‘moving’

Python does not automatically calculate a transformation matrix for you. This is only possible if your images contain
similar features, which is the case here, as this quick registration is intensity based. There are ways to do this in
Python using an OpenCV library. Since this library isn’t installed natively with Anaconda, I invite you to explore
those concepts on your own.
You have to specify a transform matrix on your own, which is essentially a coordinate matching problem. This seems
harder initially, but for most of the data this is the only way forward because features will not match in different
information channels (topography & Raman for example)

We have selected few points quickly here. As the number of points is increased and the coordinates are more carefully
selected, the registration quality improves substantially

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 276-296

.. code-block:: default


    # First normalize the up and downscaled images:
    z_upscaled = normalize_image(z_upscaled)
    topo_downscaled = normalize_image(topo_downscaled)

    # define the topography as the image that is fixed and the upscaled Z contrast image as the one that moves
    # during the image registration
    fixed = high_res_topo
    moving = z_upscaled

    # Define the points that are common:
    src = [(520, 522),
           (290, 750),
           (780, 94),
           (864, 508)]
    dst = [(561, 527),
           (325, 740),
           (799, 190),
           (882, 576)]

Let's visualize the pointers on the two images

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 298-310

.. code-block:: default


    # First plot the two images
    fig, axes = twin_image_plot([high_res_topo, z_upscaled],

                                 'Z contrast upscaled to topography size'],
                                cmap='gray')

    # Now add the markers

    plot_markers(axes[0], src, pointer_colors)
    plot_markers(axes[1], dst, pointer_colors)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 311-312

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 312-318

.. code-block:: default


    fig, axis = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))

    axis.imshow(moving, cmap='Blues', alpha=0.8)
    axis.set_title('Images overlayed')


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 319-341

Image Registration
----------------------------------------
Before starting the registration, we need to provide an optimizer configuration and a metric. OPTIMIZER contains
settings used to configure the intensity similarity optimization.  METRIC configures the image similarity metric to
be used during registration.

The next set of statements populates a transform_cell with different types of registrations available:

* Translation – translation types of distortion
* Rigid – translation and rotation types of distortion
* Similarity – translation, rotation and scale types of distortion
* Affine -- translation, rotation, scale and shear types of distortion

In cases when you aren’t sure which transformation is best, and time is permitting. All 4 can be tried.

Lets take a closer look inside the transformation process:

Inside this loop we are registering an image, getting the transform, applying it to the ‘moving’ data set and
inspecting the results.
Since we are not sure which transform to pick, we are trying all of them one at a time – hence why this code is
inside a ‘for’ loop
We use the Pearson Correlation to look at how well (higher number is better) each of the transforms performed
