Fourier transforms offer a very fast and convenient means to analyze and filter 
multidimensional data including images. The power of the Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) is due in part to (as the name suggests) its speed and also to the fact that 
complex operations such as convolution and differentiation/integration are made much 
simpler when performed in the Fourier domain. For instance, convolution in the real 
space domain can be performed using multiplication in the Fourier domain, and 
differentiation/integration in the real space domain can be performed by 
multiplying/dividing by iω in the Fourier domain (where ω is the transformed variable). 
We will take advantage of these properties and demonstrate simple image filtering and 
convolution with example.   

A few properties/uses of FFT’s are worth reviewing.

In this example we will load an image, Fourier transform it, apply a smoothing filter, and transform it back.

We will be using an image available on our GitHub project page by default. You are encouraged
to download this document as a Jupyter Notebook (button at the bottom of the page) and use your own image instead.
When using your own image, you can skip this cell and provide the path to your data as 2D numpy array using the
variable - ``image_raw``

Coming back to our example, lets start by downloading the file from GitHub:

The image is formatting according to the Universal Spectroscopic and Imaing Data (USID) model and is stored in a
Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) file. To learn more about this standardized file format for imaging and spectroscopic
data, please visit `here <https://pycroscopy.github.io/USID/about.html>`_.
However, data formatting will not be the focus of this example.

Here, we will load the data out of this standardized format and into numpy using a few simple commands found in our
sister software package - ``pyUSID``:

Prior to transforming, it is sometimes convenient to set the image mean to zero, 
because if the mean value of an image is large, the magnitude of the zero-frequency 
bin can dominate over the other signals of interest.

An important aspect of performing Fourier transforms is keeping track of units 
between transformations and also being aware of conventions used with regard to
the locations of the image centers and extents when transformed.

We start by extracting the vectors that define the X and Y axis. Unlike conventional text files
or popular image formats, which do not capture this information, the USID model captures all this
scientifically important metadata. Let us visualize this information before extracting it:

    x_edge_length = np.round(x_axis_vec[-1], 1)  # 5.0 [nm]

    x_sampling = x_pixels / x_edge_length  # [pixels/nm]
    y_sampling = y_pixels / y_edge_length  # [pixels/nm]
    x_axis_vec = np.linspace(-x_edge_length / 2, x_edge_length / 2, x_pixels)  # vector of locations along x-axis
    y_axis_vec = np.linspace(-y_edge_length / 2, y_edge_length / 2, y_pixels)  # vector of locations along y-axis
    x_mat, y_mat = np.meshgrid(x_axis_vec, y_axis_vec)  # matrices of x-positions and y-positions








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 149-154

Similarly, the axes in the Fourier domain are defined below. Note, that since 
the number of pixels along an axis is even, a convention must be followed as to 
which side of the halfway point the zero-frequency bin is located. In Matlab, the 
zero frequency bin is located to the left of the halfway point. Therefore the axis 
extends from -ω_sampling/2 to one frequency bin less than +ω_sampling/2.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 165-169

Plotting the magnitude 2D-FFT on a vertical log scales shows something unexpected:
there appears to be peaks at the corners and no information at the center. 
This is because the output for the ‘fft2’ function flips the frequency axes so 
that low frequencies are at the ends, and the highest frequency is in the middle.

The first filter we want to make is a 2D, radially symmetric, low-pass Gaussian filter. 
To start with, it is helpful to redefine the Fourier domain in polar coordinates to make
building the radially symmetric function easier.

Application of the filter to the data in the Fourier domain is done simply by 
dot-multiplying the two matrices.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 218-227

To view the filtered data in the space domain, simply use the inverse fast Fourier transform
(‘ifft2’). Remember though that python expects low frequency components at the corners, so 
it is necessary to use the inverse of the ‘fftshift’ command (‘ifftshift’) before performing
the inverse transform. Also, note that even though theoretically there should be no imaginary
components in the inverse transformed data (because we multiplied two matrices together that
were both symmetric about 0), some of the numerical manipulations create small round-off 
errors that result in the inverse transformed data being complex (the imaginary component is
~1X1016  times smaller than the real part). In order to account for this, only the real part
of the result is kept.

Filtering can also be used to help flatten an image. To demonstrate this, let’s artificially
add a background to the original image, and later try to remove it.

Since large scale background distortions (such as tilting and bowing) are primarily low
frequency information. We can make a filter to get rid of the lowest frequency components. 
Here we again use a radially symmetric 2D Gaussian, however in this case we invert it so 
that it is zero at low frequencies and 1 at higher frequencies.
